## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read.csv("loan_data.csv" , header = T)
print(data)
```
```{r}
Income <- filter(data, annual_inc < 100000)
print(Income)

```
```{r}
ggplot(data = Income) + geom_bar(mapping=aes(x = term, fill = term)) + labs(title = "Term Distribution", x ="Term (Months)", y ="Frequency")

```

```{r}

ggplot(data = Income) + geom_jitter(mapping=aes(x = term, y = annual_inc, colour = term)) + labs(title = "Annual Income Distribution", x ="Term (Months)", y ="Annual Income Amount")

```

```{r}

ggplot(Income ,aes(x = annual_inc, y = revol_bal, fill = revol_bal)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter()

```
